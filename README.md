# branching

The purpose of this repository is to show in the code-and-tell of the weekly MESSAGEix meeting
- what a commit is,
- what GitHub does if you push a commit to your branch and
- what happens if you merge/rebase.

The goal of this code-and-tell is to deepen the understanding of what git does with different commands you give, and the impacts they have on the commit history/your branch.

To see the current commit history of the repository, please check out [Insights > Network](https://github.com/LauWien/branching/network).
